Subject: Apology for Missing Meeting

Dear [Meeting Organizer's Name],

I wanted to reach out and apologize for missing the [Meeting Name] that took place on [Date]. I know how important it was for everyone to be there, and I'm truly sorry for not being able to attend.

Unfortunately, [briefly mention the reason for missing the meeting, e.g. "I had an unexpected personal commitment" or "I underestimated the time required for my tasks"]. I should have communicated this with you earlier, and for that, I'm truly sorry.

If there was anything that I missed or any key points that I need to catch up on, please let me know and I'll do my best to review the materials and stay up-to-date.

Thank you for your understanding, and please don't hesitate to reach out if there's anything I can do to make up for missing the meeting.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

You can customize this email to fit your specific situation and tone. Remember to include the following:

* A clear apology for missing the meeting
* A brief explanation for why you missed it (optional)
* An offer to catch up on any missed information
* A polite closing and signature

Feel free to modify it as needed!
